# ðŸŽ“ Graduate-Employability-Predictor

The Graduate Employability predictor targets to assess an undergraduate's likelihood of being employed after graduation using a data driven approach. The system uses the Graduate Employability Dataset from Kaggle. 

Data preprocessing techniques were applied to handle missing values, standardize data, and encode categorical variables. We trained several models such as, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. 

Then we selected the more suitable model to develop our system. The trained model was integrated into a web-based application that allows users to enter their details and rapidly predict employability status. 

This solution supports educational institutions and career counselors in identifying undergraduates who may need additional guidance and help undergraduates understand the factors influencing their employability outcomes.
